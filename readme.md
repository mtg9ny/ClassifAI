# ClassifAI

This project is a classification program that utilizes deep learning algorithms to accurately classify common household pets. Currently, the program focuses on classifying images of cats and dogs, with the aim of expanding to include other pets in the future.

Tech used: Python, TensorFlow, OpenCV, scikit-learn, and Keras.

The program provides an intuitive user interface where users can upload images and quickly obtain accurate classifications with an average classification accuracy of approximately 95%.

## Usage

- `train` - images to train the model
- `validation` - images to validate the model
- `main.py` - GUI to allow user to upload an image and classify it
- `trained_model.h5` - the created model
- `training.py` - script to train the model
